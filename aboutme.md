title: About me
subtitle: GIS Analyst & Geospatial Data Specialist
---

I am a GIS analyst with a background in Geography and a Master’s degree in Geographic Information Technologies and Spatial Data Science.

### Professional Background & Technical Focus

I have experience working on municipal- and regional-scale projects related to territorial planning, urban quality, environmental analysis, and cultural and natural heritage. My work has involved geospatial data collection, validation, and analysis, as well as the development of GIS databases and visual tools to support public decision-making.

From a technical perspective, I place a strong emphasis on working with open-source software, documenting methodologies, and integrating code into my GIS workflows. My main tools include QGIS, Python, R, and PostGIS. I am particularly interested in working and learning with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). More recently, my technical interests have expanded to include Drones, Linux-based environments, as well as 3D printing and CAD as extensions of my skill set.

This website serves as a personal space to document selected GIS projects, technical workflows, and experiments, primarily focused on geospatial data analysis and open geospatial technologies.
