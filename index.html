I am a GIS analyst with a background in Geography and a Master’s degree in Geographic Information Technologies and Spatial Data Science.
My work focuses on spatial analysis, geospatial data management and decision-support tools, mainly using open-source software.
I have experience in municipal projects, environmental and urban analysis, and territorial planning at local scale.
